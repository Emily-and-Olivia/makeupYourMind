// PSEUDO CODE
// Store the users input (from the dropdown menu and checkboxes) within a variable
// Listen for user to click the submit button
// Request data from the API
// Once the request has been made, using the response we get back pass a parameter which represents the data endpoint
// add parameters/search terms to the base url using the search params
// IF no products match the users request, show a message asking to search again
// create an <li> element and save within a variable
// Upon submit, append the filtered results onto the page (include image, product name and price) within the <ul>
// IF there is no price included on the product, do not append to page
// create a reset button and listen for user click to clear results from page
